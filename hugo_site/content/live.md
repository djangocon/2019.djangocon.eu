# Asking questions during talks

## Internet questions

During talks, a host will select questions from the internet crowd. You can tag your
question on Twitter with `#djangoconQA` or send a question on the IRC channel
`#djangocon` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/).

Questions asked are subject to our [Code of Conduct](/conduct/) and any
perceived violations will be filtered out.

## Attendee questions

If a speaker takes questions after a talk, we encourage you to come to the mic ðŸŽ¤
placed in the room. We will also take questions from internet audiences if time
permits.

## Asking good questions

Please ask questions that are constructive and supportive:

* **A good question**: Is not a comment, and ends in a question mark; is one that
  seeks to explore the topic of the talk; is perceived valuable to others in the
  audience; clarifies something that you found hard to understand in the talk;
  breaks the silence of the crowd, asking a supportive question for the speaker;
  the self-less question that seeks to bind knowledge from other people in the
  crowd with the speaker's; the practical recommendation that doesn't demand to
  know why the speaker didn't mention a, b, c.

You can read more examples of good conference questions in this
[Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/nov/11/dont-be-a-conference-troll-a-guide-to-asking-good-questions).

* **A bad question**: Is something that seeks to only emphasize your own
  knowledge; seeks details at a level that is irrelevant to most people; or
  tries to trick the speaker, make them look bad or point out errors.

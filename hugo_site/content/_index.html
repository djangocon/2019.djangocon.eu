<p>DjangoCon Europe is run <strong>by</strong> the community <strong>for</strong> the community: We are the 11th European conference, made up of <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> practitioners from all levels. We welcome people from all over the world. Our conference seeks to educate and develop new skills, best practices and ideas for the benefit of attendees, developers, speakers and everyone in our global Django Community, not least those watching the talks online.</p>

<p>Our mission is also beyond Django as a technology: Our conference values diversity and inclusivity and seeks to have a real impact on people’s lives and local communities. Please read our <a href="/cfp/">Call for Participation</a> and our <a href="/conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p>The conference consists of 3 days of talks and a few workshops, followed by 2 days of free <a href="/sprints/">sprints</a> in the following weekend. On the day before the conference, a 1-day <a href="https://djangogirls.org/copenhagen/" target="_blank">Django Girls</a> workshop is held.</p>

## Become a part of DjangoCon Europe

The 11th edition of DjangoCon Europe in 2019 is held in beautiful Scandinavian capital Copenhagen.

DjangoCon Europe is a conference run **by** the Django community **for** the Django community and we believe this is the best conference for partners and sponsors to connect **with** the Django community. 

The Django community is proud of being very diverse and showing mutual respect for each other. It has existed more than a decade and is therefore very professional and mature. It is inclusive to hobbyists, newcomers, professionals, enthusiasts, managers, marketers and the list goes on! This community live and flourish across the whole globe on all continents.

We are run 100% by passionate volunteers and we run on a not-for-profit basis! Because inclusiveness is a must and to maintain diversity it entails the conference must be affordable and this is where you as a sponsor and/or partner is crucial! We need all the support we can get to make this 11th DjangoCon Europe happen!

## Why should you sponsor?

**Marketing** Do you have a product or service that is loved by or will be loved by Django/Python developers? Here you can expose your self with your logo as well as host demos and meet everyone by having a booth.

**Recruitment** Let's admit, software developers are hard to get and they are not actively looking for a job themselves. Therefore, to meet and be present for the world's best Django developers at this event is both lucrative and unique.

**Community** Be a community leader and give back to the open-source community Django _is_. As a part of the conference individuals from all countries can apply for grants to make it possible to attend this, for some, life-changing event. Further, the ticket price is kept low to ensure also private people can attend the conference.

**Diversity** Everyone is welcome at DjangoCon Europe, should be able to attend this conference and be in their comfort zone while doing so. Diversity encapsulates much and we with this conference are proud to embrace it! [Diversity](https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/) is a part of the Django Project's DNA and always will be.

**Networking** If you want to stand out from the crowd with your company, network and seek new potential collaborations and partners, DjangoCon Europe is the place to be. Also, with most sponsor packages are tickets included and your employees will, therefore, attend a conference with valuable education from talks and workshops.

## What does your money go to?

We have made a large sponsorship menu to invite all to contribute and to give you the opportunity to customise your support. The list of expenses for the event is long and the list does not include items that are not important to run the event. Here is an insight:

 * venue rental
 * technical equipment
 * catering (locally produced)
 * financial assistance program
 * video recording of talks
 * live speech-to-text transcription of all talks
 * free child care for our attendees and their children
 * ...

If there are profits from the conference, they are administrated by the registered Danish association [Django Denmark](https://django-denmark.org/), whose purpose is to serve open source Django communities in the Nordic region and in economically marginalized countries. We expect the Nordic region to be more active with community events in the wake of this event.

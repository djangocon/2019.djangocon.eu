Pack your laptop for the [Sprints](/sprints/) - a tradition at DjangoCon Europe!
This year is no exception. Therefore, we've made sure to get a pretty large
venue for the event!

Sign-up is both available when buying your ticket and afterwards in the
<a href="https://members.2019.djangocon.eu/">ticketholder area</a>. We hope that
you can help *our planning* by signing up today -- but not least, helping out
Django or all the related open source projects that you can work on and learn to
contribute to during this packed weekend.

It's in a very central location, just next to the lakes of Copenhagen:

It's not just that the venue is decently sized, but we can also stay there a bit
late -- and the outside areas and dining options are great as well!


**See you there!**

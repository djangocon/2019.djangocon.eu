During the DjangoCon Europe 2019, the [Code of Conduct](/conduct/) team was very pleased to see how well the Django community got well together. We prepared ourselves to face a few incidents, but fortunately things turned out better than we thought. We were extremely satisfied with the positive atmosphere we had at the conference.

Guided by previous DjangoCons, these are some of the things we planned to secure a pleasant experience:

- Review all slides for the Talks and Sprints and guide speakers on the usage of pictures/memes;
- All participants had to agree with the Code of Conduct when purchasing a ticket;
- The Code of Conduct was printed and attached to the entrance of the venue;
- A phone number to get in direct contact with the Code of Conduct Team was available during the whole event;
- We made sure a member of the Code of Conduct team was made physically available at both the conference venue and at the party;

Although no incidents were reported, a few participants brought to our attention something: someone walking around with a t-shirt that they thought could be an insult to some. Upon investigation, we found out the person was part of the venue's staff. Then, by having a kind and informal conversation to the venue's director, we got to know the t-shirt owner's background a bit more. We decided that the situation could not disrespect any member of our event, given the context. And as expected, no one filled a formal report about this matter.

It was an amazing experience for all of the DjangoCon CoC Team. We were extremely satisfied with the outcome of the conference and even more importantly, with the ambiance the community provided to itself. We are definitely looking forward to contributing to future events such as this.

# Hospitality

It is a good idea to book your accommodation early on. One option is to buy a ticket and use the attendee channels to organize accommodation with others (this solution is coming up shortly). 

Should you prefer a classic hotel or hostel, we recommend staying with one of the hotels/hostels we were able to negotiate accommodation deals with. Some discounts also cover days before and after the event.

It is worth mentioning that some have not provided a discount code to be used on their website. This means you will need to send an e-mail directly to the hotel/hostel requesting your reservation. Below is the list of the establishments and the instructions on how to get your discount.
